Ellipse Detection using Hough transform in python

# Short Description:
Ellipse detection is a computer vision technique that employs the Hough Transform to 
identify ellipses within an image. The process involves defining a parameter space for 
ellipses, creating an accumulator array, and voting for potential ellipse parameters based 
on edge points in the image. After thresholding the accumulator array, the peaks 
correspond to potential ellipse parameters, which can then be extracted.

#Introduction: 
Ellipse Detection, utilizing the Circular Hough Transform, is a crucial 
aspect of computer vision, allowing for the identification of elliptical shapes in digital 
images.

#Motivation: Efficient ellipse detection is vital for various applications, including 
medical imaging, object recognition, robotics, and manufacturing quality control.
